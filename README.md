# CPU Scheduling Algorithms

## Functionalities
- 3 Algorithms are implemented.
- Each process can have different number of CPU Burst Time and I/O Burst Time.
- Gantt Chart and Timeline Chart for the given Schedule.
- Animation of the Time Log.
- Comparison between all the algorithms wrt Average Completion Time, Turn Around Time, Waiting Time and Response Time.


### Different Criteria and Algorithms

  - **Shortest Remaining Job First (SRJF)**
    >Preemptive
  - **Longest Remaining Job First (LRJF)**
    >Preemptive
- The job with the highest response ratio in the ready queue is processed first.
  - **Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN)**
    >Non-Preemptive
    
**Non-Preemptive:**
  Once a job enters the Running Queue, it will only leave when its required CPU Burst Time is completed or it requires an I/O Job.
  
  
### Technologies Used
